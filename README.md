# calculator

This calculator was created as part of the Odin Project foundation course. It will have a UI with keyboard support. Built in HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. 
In retrospect I would have approached the JS in another way. It started off way more complicated than it needed to be.

### Todo:
- [x] Add javascript functionality
- [ ] Keyboard suppport
